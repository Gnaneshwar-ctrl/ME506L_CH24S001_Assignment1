## Question 1)
### (a) assignment1_error_analysis_a.m can be used to to evaluate a function at 501 equidistance points in (0, 1) interval for both single and double precision, computing round-off error.
### (b) assignment1_erroe_analysis_b.m can be used to compute a function value with help of taylor series expansion (for given problem considered upto five terms) and estimate round off error and truncation error.
### (c) assignment1_error_analysis_c.m as part of (i) performs the 1/n summation, (ii) performed (a) on previous summation by rounding off each number upto 5 decimals, (iii) performed (a) on 1/n summation where n is reversed summation by rounding off each number upto 5 decimals
#### (c) (iv)
